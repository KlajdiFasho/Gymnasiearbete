# Gymnasiearbete - Gameboy Project

## Project Overview

This is a **Gameboy emulator/simulator project** developed as a "Gymnasiearbete" (Swedish upper secondary school graduation project). The project is written in **Python** and simulates or emulates the functionality of a classic Gameboy handheld console.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Fonts/** Directory
Contains font files and resources used for rendering text and UI elements in the Gameboy emulator.

### 2. **Games/** Directory
Holds game-related files, ROMs, or game data that can be executed within the emulator.

### 3. **Handlers/** Directory
Contains handler modules that manage:
- Input handling (button presses, controls)
- System event processing
- Core emulation logic

### 4. **code.py** - Main Entry Point
The primary Python script that orchestrates the entire Gameboy emulator, including:
- Initialization of emulator components
- Main game loop
- Rendering and display management
- Integration of handlers and resources

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Platform**: Handheld console emulation
- **Focus**: Classic Gameboy functionality
